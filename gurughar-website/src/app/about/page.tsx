            <p>
                The Sikh community in St. John’s began with three families over thirty years ago. Without a traditional Gurdwara, the families practiced in their homes and warmly welcomed guests following the ‘open doors’ custom of Sikhism. In 2005, the first Gurdwara in Newfoundland was established at 680 Logy Bay Road.
